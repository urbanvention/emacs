# Emacs Starter Kit

Copied from topfunky's repository ([Emacs Starter Kit](http://github.com/topfunky/emacs-starter-kit))

Added another colortheme, which is commented out, as it doesn't look too great on a server shell.
Addded espresso.el for javascript.
Added some snippets for lua and ruby.

# Installation

Download and rename it in your home directory to .emacs.d
If your username is foo
Rename the directory riethmayer to foo and the file riethmayer.el to foo.el.

I added some font styles in riethmayer.el. Download them and use them if you like.
You might like the color theme commented out.

# Machine specific settings

Create a local.el file in .emacs.d and add your machine specific settings.
For example, mine looks like this: [My local.el](http://gist.github.com/415995)
